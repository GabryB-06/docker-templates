<h1>404 - Page not found</h1>
This is an example of custom 404 page, feel free to replace it with any HTML or PHP file you want to appear instead of the default Apache's error page. In the default config the error page is located in the same directory as the other files to serve. You can change the file's name in the <code>conf/000-default.conf</code> file.
